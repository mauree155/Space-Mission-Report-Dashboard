# Space-Mission-Report-Dashboard
## 1. Project Background
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global space missions. The dataset includes thousands of recorded missions launched by various countries and organizations, covering both successful and unsuccessful outcomes. The aim of this analysis is to:
-	Understand the growth and trends in space exploration
- Identify the most active countries and organizations in space mission history
- Analyze mission outcomes by success, failure, partial failure, and prelaunch failure
- Highlight top-performing missions and companies contributing to space exploration

By extracting these insights, the report enables stakeholders such as researchers, educators, and policymakers to evaluate historical progress, benchmark country-level contributions, and recognize patterns in mission performance that could inform future aerospace strategy and innovation.

## 2. Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was provided during training by Quantum Analytics and contains historical records of global space missions. It includes detailed information about mission status, country of origin, and the organizations involved in each launch. Key data points captured in the dataset include:
-	Mission details: name, launch year, and company responsible
-	Mission outcomes: classified as success, failure, partial failure, or prelaunch failure
-	Geographic data: country where the mission originated
  -Organizational data: name of the company or agency responsible

In total, the dataset contains 4,630 space missions, of which 4,162 were successful.

## 3. Tools
The following tools were used to carry out this analysis:
-	Power BI: For designing the interactive dashboard and visualizing space mission trends, country-wise contributions, and mission outcomes
-	Excel: For preliminary data cleaning, formatting, and organizing mission attributes before importing into Power BI

## 4. Analytical Process
### Data Cleaning & Preparation
-	Verified the accuracy and consistency of mission outcome labels
-	Standardized country names and ensured uniformity in company identifiers
-	Filtered out incomplete mission records
-	Aggregated data by country, company, and mission outcome
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-	Analyzed global trends in mission frequency
-	Evaluated mission success rates across countries
-	Identified the top companies with the highest number of successful missions
- Assessed mission outcome distribution
### Dashboard Development
- Designed a clean, user-friendly Power BI dashboard
-	Incorporated bar charts, line graphs, and card summaries
- Included interactive filters by mission status and country
- Ensured clear communication of insights

## 5. Dashboard

The interactive Power BI dashboard created for this project highlights key statistics and patterns across global space missions. It provides a clear visual summary of mission volumes, success rates, and country contributions. Key components of the dashboard include:
-	Mission Status Overview: Displays the number of successful, failed, partial, and prelaunch failure missions
-	Mission Trend Over Time: Illustrates how the number of missions has evolved over the decades
-	Missions by Country: Highlights the top countries contributing to space missions, including the United States, Russia, and China
-	Top Performing Missions by Company: Identifies the most successful missions based on frequency and outcome
-	Mission Outcomes by Type: Offers a breakdown of mission success vs. failure and partial outcomes

Note: The dashboard includes interactive filters that allow users to explore data by country, mission status, and year range.

## 6. Key Insights
### Global Trends and Mission Volume
- **Long-Term Growth in Launches**: Space missions have shown a steady increase over the decades, with a sharp spike from the early 2000s onward. Notably, more than 2,000 missions were launched after 2000 alone, indicating an intensified global interest in space exploration, especially with the entrance of private-sector players.
- **Peak Launch Years**: Several years in the last two decades, particularly 2018, 2020, and 2021, saw record-high mission counts, surpassing 100 launches annually, signaling a new era of competition and innovation in space led by both government agencies and commercial firms.
### Mission Outcomes
- **Overall Performance**: Out of 4,630 total missions, approximately 4,162 were successful, yielding an impressive 90% success rate. However, over 460 missions failed or partially failed, highlighting the persistent technical risks in aerospace operations.
- **Failure Distribution**: Mission failures and partial failures, while not the majority, are significant enough to emphasize the need for rigorous testing, enhanced safety protocols, and engineering redundancies.
### Country Contributions
- **Top Performing Countries:** The United States leads global space activity with over 1,900 missions, followed by Russia with more than 1,400 launches. China, though a relatively newer entrant, now contributes over 500 missions, making it a rising power in space technology.
- **Uneven Global Participation:** Despite a broad range of countries participating in space missions, more than 80% of total missions originate from just a few nations, reflecting technological, economic, and geopolitical disparities in access to space infrastructure.

## 7. Recommendations
Based on analytical insights from the dashboard, the following strategic recommendations are proposed:
- **Strengthen Mission Safety Protocols:** Despite high success rates, mission failures call for continuous refinement of safety systems, launch preparations, and contingency planning.
-	**Encourage Broader International Participation:** Support collaboration and knowledge sharing across more countries to reduce overdependence on a few dominant nations.
- **Support Emerging Space Organizations:** Offer funding, technical partnerships, and shared infrastructure to smaller or new players, thereby encouraging innovation and industry resilience.
-	**Invest in Data Transparency and Reporting:** Encourage consistent reporting formats and data sharing among space agencies to improve global tracking and performance analysis.
-	**Leverage the Dashboard for Continuous Monitoring:** The interactive Power BI dashboard should serve as an ongoing tool for insight generation, trend tracking, and informed decision-making.

## 8. Conclusion
This space mission analysis offers a detailed historical overview of global space activity. Through interactive visualizations, we uncover mission trends, dominant players, and performance outcomes that reflect both the achievements and challenges in space exploration.
By acting on the insights and recommendations provided, stakeholders can enhance safety, promote international collaboration, and support a more balanced, innovative, and inclusive global space ecosystem. The Power BI dashboard stands as a powerful tool to guide this future with data-driven clarity and foresight.
